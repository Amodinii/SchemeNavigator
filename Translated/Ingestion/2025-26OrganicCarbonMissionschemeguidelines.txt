Increasing the level of organic carbon in the soil is not only given high priority under the government's Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) but also makes it essential to add various organic manures that help in easily increasing production.

It has been observed that in the soils used for various crops across the state, the organic matter content and the organic carbon level are decreasing. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the soil's organic carbon status. The organic carbon content can be increased by adding organically available inputs to the soil, such as farmyard manure, compost, vermicompost, crop residue incorporation (uruá¸·i), green manure, other crop residues, and organic fertilizers. To this end, growing leguminous crops as mixed crops and incorporating green manure crops can also effectively increase the biological organic carbon in the soil.

Organic carbon not only enables the soil to retain more moisture but also maintains good physical properties of the soil. When organic manure is added to the soil, the resulting decomposition process makes essential nutrients readily available to plants and also reduces the loss of these nutrients. This scheme is beneficial as it increases microbial activity, thereby enhancing the quantity of available plant nutrients and ensuring greater availability of the most essential nutrients for the crop.

Since it is in the form of Humus, it is easily available to plants. Besides naturally preparing an improved soil structure, it increases the soil's water retention capacity, enhances microorganism activity, and provides essential nutrients and organic carbon to the maize crop.

By increasing organic carbon, it becomes possible to convince farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers without a decline in yield. This enables them to achieve sustainable yields by adopting long-term soil fertility and sustainable agricultural practices. Through this, the organic carbon content in the soil is increased.

To implement the following physical components for the year 2025-26;

**a) Navabharat Carbon Enhancement Demonstrations:**
To demonstrate new technologies for increasing organic carbon on farmers' fields, demonstrations will be organized by providing a subsidy of Rs. 2500/- (100%) per demonstration to increase organic carbon in the soil.

2025-26 Organic carbon mission guidelines


Creating awareness among farmers about its availability. Green manure seeds can be provided to farmers who conduct demonstrations. The beneficiary farmers themselves must bear the costs incurred beyond the specified subsidy. To arrange for two demonstrations, each covering one hectare, in every district. In coordination with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (Agricultural Science Centers), to decide upon and implement recent, innovative scientific demonstrations on increasing organic carbon in the soil, according to the needs of the districts.

A minimum of two demonstrations should be conducted in a single farmer's field. The amount of organic carbon and other nutrients should be analyzed at Soil Health Centers before conducting the demonstration and again two years after the demonstration. When submitting the report of the said demonstrations to the central office as per Form-2, it must include the analysis report and details of the materials distributed to the farmers.

For this program, under the Reference Head: Subsidy (106), a grant of Rs. 0.775 lakhs has been provided for the year 2025-26. The district-wise physical and financial targets are provided in the annexure.

**a) Distribution of Green Manure Seeds:**

Green manures, besides providing plant nutrients in-situ at a low cost and improving soil structure, water retention capacity, and biological activity by adding organic matter, also provide a boost. It is necessary to further popularize green manures. In this regard, it is appropriate to use green manure crops such as Dhaincha, Sunnhemp, Sesbania, Gliricidia, leguminous pulse crops, etc. To encourage the use of green manure, the seeds of these crops are to be provided to farmers at a 75% subsidized rate or at a rate of Rs. 3000/- per hectare. The subsidy is to be limited to two hectares per farmer. This

For the program for the year 2025-26, a grant of Rs. 214.165 lakhs under U.Khe: SaA(106), Rs. 60.53 lakhs under the Kharif and Sub-plan (422), and Rs. 24.53 lakhs under the Tribal Sub-plan (423) has been provided. The department-wise physical and financial targets are given in the annexure.

**General Instructions:**

*   While providing benefits under the scheme, priority should be given to small and marginal farmers.
*   Under all schemes, progress must be achieved as per the prescribed reservation ratio for farmers belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women, Minorities, and those with disabilities.
*   The minimum targeted sowing plan must be mandatorily entered into the departmental K-Kisan software.
*   The physical and financial progress report, in the prescribed formats 1 and 2, must be submitted without fail by the 5th of every month via e-mail to ddamanure2024@gmail.com.
